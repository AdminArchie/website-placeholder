# website-placeholder

## About
The website-placeholder is a small, fast loading static website that you can use as a placeholder on your website. The placeholder is also fully responsive, meaning that even phone users can see it! See the project in use [here](http://charliebritton.github.io/website-placeholder)!

## Use Cases
This is ideal for use if you are building a website for your company and you don't want the domain to be parked by your host.

## Licensing
